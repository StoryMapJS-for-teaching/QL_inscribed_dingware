Inscription text:
簇粉堆花雙鳳蕤 
色堆殷尚樸無奇 
侵尋朱氏宣成代 
遂有精描五采施 
乾隆丁酉春御題

BM poem translation:
Amid accumulated pollen and massed flowers the two phoenixes droop their wings. 
The colour is confined to that prized by the Yin dynasty, simple and unadorned. 
It is not till we come down to the Zhu dynasty and Xuan[de] and Cheng[hua] 
that we get elaborate painting and employment of five colours. 
Composed by the Qianlong Emperor in the Spring of the dingyou year [AD 1777]
